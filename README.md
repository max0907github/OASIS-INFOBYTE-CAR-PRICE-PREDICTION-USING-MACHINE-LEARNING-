## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/max0907github/OASIS-INFOBYTE-CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OASIS-INFOBYTE-CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook OASIS_INFOBYTE_DS_03_Car-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning.ipynb
   ```

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Modeling
Several regression models were implemented:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

Each model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

## Evaluation
The best-performing model was selected based on its ability to minimize error and maximize prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of machine learning techniques and their application in real-world scenarios. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects!
